Syntax---------------------------------------------------------------
	Enzymes
		We think that enzymes are necessary for paraGAT because in 
		order to build instruction stacks, each instruction will need 
		sticky-ends to latch onto the tick and tock glue.
		Though this may, in some instances, be unnecessary, in others, 
		such as the DNA oragami, excess stands woulld generate 
		problems with the spacing of the folds.

		We propose that there be a specific set of primitives 
		& functions to use enzymes.
			e.g. <Enzyme Type> Enzyme <Variable>
			There would need to be a way to specify what the 
			enzyme would do (e.g. for a restiction enzyme what 
			it would cut)
	User Help
		User needs instuctions to orient the pipette machine, 
		as well as pauses to place iron balls into the machine
		or remove them.
		How does the user of the language dictate how much DNA 
		there is in each test tube and how much of that DNA 
		is actually used during the process (i.e. is one tock
		cycle assumed to be 50 microliters, or is that defined
		by the user? Is it possible to have a set ratio in the
		program, have the user input only one number (i.e number
		of pegs desired), and have the machine adjust the amount of
		all other required materials accordingly?)
		Can we use an array to organize substances?
	Functions
		What is function syntax?




Questions------------------------------------------------------------
	Do we have variable types?
	For things like the iron collection balls, would a user
	perhaps looking at a screen prompt, place them into the
	solution?
